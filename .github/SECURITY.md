## Reporting a Vulnerability

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to determine how they are addressed.

2. Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) detailing the suspected vulnerability. Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the potential issue.
3. We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and you can expect a detailed response within 96 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.
4. Please refrain from disclosing your findings to the public or any third party until we have addressed it.

### Expectations:

Upon reporting, please expect the following:

- A confirmation of receipt of your vulnerability report.
- A request for more information if necessary.
- Notification on the status of the reported issue.
- Recognition for your discovery, if you wish.

## Public Disclosure

The public disclosure date will be coordinated with you after the vulnerability has been fully understood and a fix is implemented. We aim to keep the public and our users informed about any security issues and want to ensure that proper time is allotted for a fix to be developed, tested, and deployed.
